<!-- Units -->
<!-- 
1. Absolute Units are Fixed they are not change anyway (they are absolutly wast) but we can use these units in some places like a website logo 
Ex: px, cm, mm, in, pc, pt

2. Relative Units are responsive it change accoirding to parent or Viewport, it will takes the referance from parent
Ex: % (takes ref from parent) 
    vw (takes ref from viewport width)
    vh (takes ref from viewport height)
above vw & vh are two use mostly in child ele so it takes ref from viewport not parenet so parent no need to change

3. html tag ka font size will be 16px
4. h1 to h6 ke chod ke entire html tags are takes 16 px font size
5. 1em menas 1 times (matlab jitna he utna he) the em will takes ref from parent ele, 2em means 2 times the parent ele
6. rem takes ref from root ele
7. 1rem means 1 times of root ele means 1 times of html tag bcz html is root ele
8. 2rem means 2 times of root ele means 2 times of html tag
9. we have 2 more relative units in css that name as:
    vmin (min between w/h)and vmax(max between w/h) -->
